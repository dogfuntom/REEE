REcommendation Engine Extension

How to install
---

The extension is not in Firefox's or Chrome's extension store yet.
It's still possible to try it using `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` page in Firefox.
(Chrome support is coming soon.)

3rd-party libraries
---

This extension doesn't use any 3rd-party libraries at all. However, a single third-party CSS (cascading style sheets) [file](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/andybrewer/mvp/blob/v1.7.3/mvp.css&sa=D&source=hangouts&ust=1627250707060000&usg=AFQjCNGh2OJ82r5cB8XGt_Br3br89C0HWw) is used: [MVP.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/).
