## Development

### VS Code

Overall this is a folder for opening in VS Code including recommended extensions.
To build use VS Code task, or do it manually (see the task's definition or the "Other editors" section here).

### Other editors

Most likely it's easy to use any other editor, even if it doesn't have similar recommended extensions.
(Both recommended extensions are just minor conveniences atm.)
To build do manually the same thing as described in <.vscode/tasks.json>.
